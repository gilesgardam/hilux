# `hilux` - my personal utility for GAP

This is code that might otherwise live in a file called `util.gap`.
I find it useful and you might too.

## Installation

This package is written in pure GAP so there is basically no installation needed -- just clone this repo in the `pkg` subdirectory of (one of) your [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org) root directories.
If you don't know where they are, type `GAPInfo.RootPaths;` at the GAP prompt to find out.

## Documentation

At present I'm not planning on writing documentation outside the source code and the [demo test file](tst/demo.tst) (where I intend to demonstrate all the functionality).
I will however use this repo to collect documentation on miscellaneous aspects of GAP I find useful to refer to, such as
* [cookbook](https://gilesgardam.github.io/hilux/cookbook.html)
* [python2gap](python2gap.txt)
